### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Angelo here!

This is definitely a work in progress readme. So don't take it too seriously.

#### :information_desk_person: Who am I?

Well, I'm a hybrid, really. I got a PhD in Information Engineering, with a focus on machine learning applied to environmental sensors; however, I am also interested in web programming using technologies such as React for front-end and Flask for back-end.

#### ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on...

I found a lack of open source tutorials and knowledge in my native language (Italian). Therefore, I'm starting to create some "books", which will be hosted on GitHub Pages, to share my (little) knowledge to Italian speakers.

#### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning...

A lot of things, including:

* Something about the history of the Free and Open Source Software.
* Something about the history of videogames (this is actually my deepest, most relevant hobby).
* How to create a chicken coop (yes, I know).
* How to start two blogs and don't die trying.
* React, .NET Core, Keras, for work and fun.

#### âš¡ Fun facts

I'm not a funny person. Still, fun facts usually happen around me.
